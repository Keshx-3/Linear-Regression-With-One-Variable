# Linear-Regression-With-One-Variable
Sample problem of predicting home price in Monroe, new jersey (USA)
This project aims to predict real estate prices using Linear Regression. The model is trained on a dataset containing information about different properties, such as area and price, and then predicts the price of a property based on its area.

**Project Overview**

Data Preparation: The dataset is loaded and cleaned to ensure it is ready for modeling.
Feature Selection: The most relevant features, such as area, are selected for building the model.
Model Training: A Linear Regression model is trained on the dataset.
Prediction: The model is used to predict the price of a property based on its area.
Evaluation: The model's performance is evaluated using appropriate metrics.
